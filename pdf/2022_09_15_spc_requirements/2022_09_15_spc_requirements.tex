\begin{frame}{Current Mode of Operation}\fns
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] Stock assessors are hired on 3-year contracts,\\
    update assessments are produced every 3 years\\[3ex]

    \item[] It takes more than 3 years to become proficient enough in MFCL to
    produce a\\
    stock assessment, with changes involving data components and model
    settings\\[3ex]

    \item[] This process has worked (to a varying degree) because we have John
    and Nick\\
    to continually guide and mentor the new stock assessors\\[3ex]

    \item[] Without Nick and John, this process would not work\\[3ex]

    \item[] It would require at least 2 people each with 10 years of MFCL
    experience to\\
    have the level of expertise to take over the roles of John and Nick\\[3ex]

    \item[] With Dave Fournier retiring in 2021, the development of MFCL is
    severely hampered\\[3ex]

    \item[] In a few years, when John and Nick retire, the team may consist of
    only new stock assessors\\[3ex]
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ______________________________________________________________________________

\begin{frame}{Changes Ahead}\fns
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] In a few years, if the team does not have stock assessors with 10
    years of MFCL experience...\\[3ex]
    \item[] ...then it is not very likely that they will use MFCL to conduct the
    tuna stock assessments, as\\
    this would be much more challenging than the (already challenging) current
    mode of operation\\[3ex]
    \item[] Current stock assessment platforms that could be considered
    include:\\[0.5ex]
    \begin{itemize}\fns
      \item[] Casal2, Gadget, Stock Synthesis\\[2ex]
    \end{itemize}
    \item[] Future stock assessment platforms that could be considered
    include:\\[0.5ex]
    \begin{itemize}\fns
      \item[] SAM with length + regions + tags\\[1ex]
      \item[] WHAM with length + regions + tags\\[1ex]
      \item[] FIMS model with length + regions + tags\\[1ex]
      \item[] SPC developed model with length + regions + tags\\[3ex]
    \end{itemize}
    It is very likely that future SPC assessments will have a CKMR model
    component\\[3ex]
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ______________________________________________________________________________

\begin{frame}{Stock Synthesis}\fns
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] SS has been used for tuna assessments in the Indian Ocean and the
    Eastern Pacific Ocean\\[4ex]
    \item[] IOTC yellowfin assessment has 4 regions and tagging data, takes one
    hour to run\\[4ex]
    \item[] Current (and future) stock assessors are experienced SS users\\[4ex]
    \item[] SS has a larger developer and user base than any other
    platform\\[4ex]
    \item[] R4SS provides a feature-rich automated set of standard plots that
    are pasted directly into assessment reports\\[4ex]
    \item[] An experimental CKMR component has been added to SS\\[4ex]
    \item[] FIMS model will have a well supported transition from SS to
    FIMS\\[4ex]
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ______________________________________________________________________________

\begin{frame}{Casal2}\fns
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] Casal2 seems to have better support than SS for multiregional models
    with tagging data\\[5ex]
    \item[] The development team is small and the optimization engine may be
    less efficient than\\
    ADMB and TMB-based platforms
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ______________________________________________________________________________

\begin{frame}{FIMS}\fns
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] Like SAM, WHAM, and bespoke assessment models, the FIMS project uses
    TMB that allows efficient use of random effects\\[5ex]
    \item[] The exact timeline and products from the FIMS project are difficult
    to predict\\[5ex]
    \item[] It is possible that it will not produce a model platform that is fit
    for SPC tuna\\
    assessments in the next 10 years\\[4ex]
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ______________________________________________________________________________

\begin{frame}{Transition Plan Stages}\fns
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] Experimental SS models\\[4ex]
    \item[] SPC workshops inviting external SS experts\\[4ex]
    \item[] Parallel/staggered MFCL + SS assessments\\[4ex]
    \item[] Full and accepted SS assessments\\[4ex]
    \item[] Ensure MFCL components are carried over to future platforms\\[4ex]
    \item[] FIMS involvement and contributions\\[4ex]
    \item[] This will involve a lot of extra work compared to the traditional
    work cycle,\\
    but we cannot shrug and wait a few more years...

Tell Jim the story:

SPC will be transitioning all assessments from MULTIFAN-CL to other software.

The swordfish and striped marlin assessments transitioned to Stock Synthesis in
2025.

Some of the WCPFC tuna stocks have specific requirements for future assessments.
For example, skipjack should use the state-of-the-art statistical techniques for
analyzing tagging data, while albacore will transition to software that can
incorporate close-kin mark-recapture data that are currently being collected.

A new statistical approach looks promising for analyzing skipjack tagging data
using a spatio-temporal model. This method produces abundance indices that can
be incorporated into any stock assessment platform, such as Stock Synthesis.

One outcome from reaching out to tuna RFMOs is that IATTC has outlined a general
design for developing a new tuna model, based on RTMB. This development work
stream will be initiated with an online CAPAM workshop on this topic.

Compared to an IATTC designed model in RTMB, the FIMS pathway to developing a
new tuna stock assessment software is subject to somewhat higher levels of
uncertainty and risks. Nevertheless, the scoping project is planning an SPC-FIMS
workshop to examine and evaluate the FIMS development option.

Gadget represents certain state-of-the-art statistical methods of interest, and
the scoping project will examine the model configuration, results, and
diagnostics as a useful reference for designing any future tuna assessment
software.

Ultimately, there are important benefits in using the same software as other
tuna RFMOs. The WCPFC partnership with IATTC is especially relevant for
collaborative research and development of new stock assessment software.

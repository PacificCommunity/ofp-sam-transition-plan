Tell Jim the story:

SPC will be transitioning all assessments from MULTIFAN-CL to other software.

The swordfish and striped marlin assessments transitioned to Stock Synthesis in
2025.

Some of the tuna stocks have specific requirements for future assessments. For
example, skipjack should use the state-of-the-art statistical techniques for
analyzing tagging data that are available at any time, while albacore will
transition to software that can incorporate close-kin mark-recapture data that
are currently being collected.

A new statistical approach looks promising for analyzing skipjack tagging data
using a spatio-temporal model. This method produces abundance indices that can
be incorporated into a Stock Synthesis assessment.

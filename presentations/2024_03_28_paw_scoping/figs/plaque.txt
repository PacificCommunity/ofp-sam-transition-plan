In 1989 the South Pacific Conference endorsed the concept of completely
rebuilding headquarters and in March 1992, a special session decided to rebuild
at another nearby site provided by New Caledonia. Secretary General Ati G.
Sokumanu personally managed this rebuilding project. The ground-breaking
ceremony took place on 28 May 1993 and the move to the new buildings
began in July 1995.

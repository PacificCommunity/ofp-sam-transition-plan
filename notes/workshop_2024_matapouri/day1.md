# Notes from Matapouri 2024

## Reasons we are interested in integrated age-length structure

Punt et al. (2020) list this is their first recommendation.

1. Spatial heterogeneity in biological processes, particularly growth

Two regions with different growth curves.

Genetic and environment: individual growth depends on where they were born and
where they live.

Fish cannot shrink when moving to a slow-growing region.

The solution is an integrated age-length structured model.

2. Cohort-specific fishing effects

Fast-growing individuals are fished harder when they are young.

In a fishery that has dome-shaped selectivity, the cohort will run the gauntlet
and at older ages, the slow-growing individuals are still being fished, while
the older are not subject to fishing anymore.

## Questions regarding Gadget

1. Has Gadget demonstrated the performance gain of sparse matrix detection and
   parallel processing?

2. Does Gadget estimate the length-based growth function, including Linf and
   variation?

3. Are tagged fish handled as separate tagged populations?

## Simulation study

By running a simulation study, we compare the run time of different software,
their relative accuracy, and the feature shortcomings.

Jeremy McKenzie has written an individual-based operating model that could be
used as an operating model to compare MFCL, Gadget, and other other software.

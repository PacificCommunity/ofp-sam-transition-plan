Dear stock assessment expert,

Following up from our Doodle poll, SPC would like to invite you to attend one of the two sessions of the online meeting on Scoping the Next Tuna Assessment Platform. Based on your time zone, pick whichever session suits you better:

Session I: 12/13 May (Sun/Mon, depending on your time zone location)
Session II: 15/16 May (Wed/Thu, depending on your time zone location)

After the two sessions, we will summarize the discussions and recommendations from both groups in one document and give you an opportunity to add further comments.

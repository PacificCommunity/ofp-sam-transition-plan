# IOTC response to scoping project questionnaire

*Dan Fu and Genevieve Phillips*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What assessment software do you use for tuna and billfish assessments? If
   possible, can you indicate which software is used for which stock?

Stock Synthesis for data rich stocks, tropical tunas, billfish, sharks

Explicit spatial structure for yellowfin and bigeye

Fleets as areas for albacore

Single area for skipjack, not covered by longline, lack of CPUE

Data-moderate stocks: CPUE

JABBA and other biomass-dynamic models

CMSY and LBSPR for neretic tuna

ELEFAN length mode progression analysis, by coastal countries for their needs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Are these software adequate for your current needs?

Yes, in terms of main functionality

Tagging data can be fitted using standard Stock Synthesis

Minor issues, such as converting length-at-release to age-at-release for tags

Region-specific growth is not supported, where migrations would become an issue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Do you the think they will still be adequate in 10 years? If not, what are
   the likely main inadequacies?

CKMR will require new software

Other than that, Stock Synthesis would still work

Growing need for random effects to efficiently model time-varying processes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. How important is explicit regional structure for the assessment and
   management of tuna and billfish stocks for your RFMO?

Important for stock assessment, in terms of tagging data, CPUE trends are
different between areas

Not that important for management

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Are tagging data important for any of your assessments? If so, which
   assessments?

Large one-off study in late 2000s

Three species: skipjack (50%), yellowfin (25%), bigeye (25%), 100k tags

50% recovery rate

Important data type in all three assessments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Given that Stock Synthesis is entering a sunset phase, do you have a strategy
   or plans in place for a post Stock Synthesis era? If yes, can you provide a
   brief description of your strategy or plans?

No plans yet

Stock Synthesis will have long-term support

Keep an eye on what software other RFMOs are using

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How closely do you follow ongoing FIMS developments? Are you directly
   involved in discussions or experimental development?

No, but aware of the software project

Will follow more closely

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Do you have any ongoing development work on improving existing stock
   assessment software or developing new software? If yes, can you provide a
   brief description?

Japan was developing an age-length structured model, but the scientist retired

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Would you be willing to work collaboratively on the evaluation and/or
   development of software tailored for tuna assessments? If yes, is it likely
   that resources or scientist time might be available for this?

Can collaborate in software development, where IOTC would focus on developing
one module, and this could be linked with other modules

Joint collaborative projects can be challenging

Scientist time can be available to evaluate and test new software

The FAO Common Oceans Program can fund international workshops

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Would your team be interested in attending an online CAPAM workshop focusing
    on current and future development of new stock assessment platforms to meet
    the needs of future tuna assessments?

Yes

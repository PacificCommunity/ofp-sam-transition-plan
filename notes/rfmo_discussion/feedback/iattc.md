# IATTC response to scoping project questionnaire

*Mark Maunder and Alex Aires-da-Silva*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What assessment software do you use for tuna and billfish assessments? If
   possible, can you indicate which software is used for which stock?

We use SS for all stocks

The main ones done by the IATTC are YFT, SKJ, and BET

We also use it for other stocks, e.g., south west swordfish, dorado, silky shark

We are also involved in assessments with other groups and these assessments are
done using SS, e.g. ISC bluefin and albacore

Joint South Pacific albacore assessment with SPC, using MULTIFAN-CL

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Are these software adequate for your current needs?

In general they are adequate based on what we are currently doing

But we doe have some issues such as trying to get understandable and flexible
asymptotic selectivity curves, limited movement options

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Do you the think they will still be adequate in 10 years? If not, what are
   the likely main inadequacies?

We believe that spatial temporal modelling of tagging data, CKMR, and spatial
modelling will be the future and SS does not do these or do them well

Our current approach, since 2024, is to analyze the tags outside the assessment
using a spatio-temporal model to produce abundance indices that are incorporated
into SS

That could still be the best approach for our tuna assessments in 10 years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. How important is explicit regional structure for the assessment and
   management of tuna and billfish stocks for your RFMO?

We think it is a key component of assessments and is likely to be key to
management in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Are tagging data important for any of your assessments? If so, which
   assessments?

Tagging data is key to our skipjack assessment

We also believe it is important for improving YFT and BET in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Given that Stock Synthesis is entering a sunset phase, do you have a strategy
   or plans in place for a post Stock Synthesis era? If yes, can you provide a
   brief description of your strategy or plans?

We do not

We are following the FIRMS and SPC approaches

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How closely do you follow ongoing FIMS developments? Are you directly
   involved in discussions or experimental development?

Mark Maunder is on the FIMS Council

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Do you have any ongoing development work on improving existing stock
   assessment software or developing new software? If yes, can you provide a
   brief description?

We do a lot of work on developing methods but not directly in developing
assessment models

One related project is developing software for spatial temporal modelling of
tagging data

This project may lead to approaches to develop spatial temporal stock assessment
models but is initially designed to produce independent estimates of biomass to
use in SS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Would you be willing to work collaboratively on the evaluation and/or
   development of software tailored for tuna assessments? If yes, is it likely
   that resources or scientist time might be available for this?

Yes, we believe that collaboration is very important

Not sure about time, but I would like to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Would your team be interested in attending an online CAPAM workshop focusing
    on current and future development of new stock assessment platforms to meet
    the needs of future tuna assessments?

Definitely

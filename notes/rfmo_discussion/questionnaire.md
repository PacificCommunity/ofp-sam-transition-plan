Dear Colleagues,

As part of a scoping project, SPC would like to reach out to all tuna RFMOs to
ask a few questions related to future development and evaluation of
next-generation stock assessment software, preparing for a post Stock Synthesis
era.

This is to start an informal discussion that we can have via email, or I'm
equally happy to give you a call and we can chat for 30 minutes instead, if
that's more convenient. The answers from the questionnaire will help us map the
landscape to decide how best to move forward.

1. What assessment software do you use for tuna assessments? If possible, can
   you indicate which software is used for which stock?

2. Are these software adequate for your current needs?

3. Do you the think they will still be adequate in 10 years? If not, what are
   the likely main inadequacies?

4. How important is explicit regional structure for the assessment and
   management of tuna stocks for your RFMO?

5. Are tagging data important for any of your assessments? If so, which
   assessments?

6. Given that Stock Synthesis is entering a sunset phase, do you have a strategy
   or plans in place for a post Stock Synthesis era? If yes, can you provide a
   brief description of your strategy or plans?

7. How closely do you follow ongoing FIMS developments? Are you directly
   involved in discussions or experimental development?

8. Do you have any ongoing development work on improving existing stock
   assessment software or developing new software? If yes, can you provide a
   brief description?

9. Would you be willing to work collaboratively on the evaluation and/or
   development of software tailored for tuna assessments? If yes, is it likely
   that resources or scientist time might be available for this?

10. Would your team be interested in attending an online CAPAM workshop focusing
    on current and future development of new stock assessment platforms to meet
    the needs of future tuna assessments?

We appreciate your time and interest and will coordinate the discussion at the
scoping project
[website](https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-transition-plan/tree/main/notes/rfmo_discussion).
Following up from the discussion, we look forward to staying in touch regarding
potential coordination and collaboration with a focus on the future of tuna
stock assessment software.

On behalf of the SPC stock assessment team,\
Arni Magnusson and Nick Davies

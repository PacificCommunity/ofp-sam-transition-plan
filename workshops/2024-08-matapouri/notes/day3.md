## Possible outcomes

The ideal outcome would be that in 10-15 years, the WCPFC tuna assessments are
conducted in software that has the following characteristics:

1. Scientific quality: has good estimation performance, makes good use of
   available data, allows spatial and temporal variability in processes, runs
   fast.

2. Beginner friendly: new staff scientists can conduct a stock assessment in
   their first year of contract, configuring and understanding the models.

3. Widely used: large development team and user community beyond SPC, new staff
   scientists can find expert help outside of SPC, tools to work with model
   input and output are feature complete and maintained outside of SPC, external
   reviewers have a good understanding of model configurations and options.

In 10-15 years, the WCPFC tuna assessments could be conducted in:

1. Stock Synthesis
2. Casal
3. Gadget
4. New software developed independently by SPC
5. New software developed jointly by tuna RFMOs, independent of FIMS
6. New FIMS software developed jointly by tuna RFMOs

Options 1, 3, and 6 are of particular interest. Stock Synthesis scores high in
criteria 2 and 3, Gadget scores high in criterion 1, while new FIMS software
developed jointly by tuna RFMOs might be the only option that can score high in
all three criteria.

The main problems that SPC is are related to criteria 2 and 3. The current usage
of MFCL already meets criterion 1, so Gadget would only provide an incremental
improvement in that criterion without solving the problems meeting criteria 2
and 3. Migrating tuna assessments from MFCL to Stock Synthesis could be a
partial sacrifice in criterion 1 to greatly improve criteria 2 and 3.

## Programming environments TMB and RTMB

TMB is the programming environment used by Gadget and FIMS, options 3 and 6.
This might mean that TMB is the most relevant programming environment for the
scoping project and upcoming development work. RTMB, on the other hand, could be
used in new software development independent of FIMS, but those options (4 and
5) are probably less likely to be chosen.

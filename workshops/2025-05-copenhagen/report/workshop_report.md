## 1. Objective

Explore the possibility of applying the Mildenberger-Nielsen spatio-temporal tagging model to SPC tagging data. The end product of such an analysis could be a region-specific abundance index that can be incorporated in a tuna stock assessment. The workshop will focus on skipjack tuna in the western and central Pacific Ocean.

## 2. Agenda

The 5-day workshop was spent discussion the current methodologies employed for analysing tagging data by both SPC and the team at DTU Aqua/IATTC, comparing them conceptually and how they are similar/different, describing and exploring the available data in the WCPO for such analyses, and discussing a workplan for implementing spatiotemporal models using WCPO tagging data into the future.

**Day One**
- Current use of tagging data in WCPO tuna stock assessments, their influence and uncertainties in abundance indices
- Overview of the Mildenberger-Nielsen spatiotemporal tagging model
- Overview of SEAPODYM, with a focus on its integration of tagging data

**Day Two**
- Overview of data issues, quality and use in WCPO/EPO
- Discussion on differences between advection-diffusion movement models
- Development of proposed models for a WCPO application of the Mildenberger-Nielsen model

**Day Three**
- Overview of momo R-package and use
- Data selection and preparation for proposed models
- Preliminary work on simplified model using WCPO data

**Day Four**
- Continued preliminary model development
- Presentation of IATTC models and results

**Day Five**
- Preliminary model results
- Wrap up and next steps

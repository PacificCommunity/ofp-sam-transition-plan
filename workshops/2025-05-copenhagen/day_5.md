#### Tobias presented an update of the prototype model

The process variability in movement (deviating from the deterministic
environmental effects) is handled by the diffussion

The Kalman filter is used in the estimation, as described in the workshop
report

We plot preference on the y-axis and the environmental variable on the x-axis
The y-axis of the preference plot

The environmental data used in SEAPODYM are stored on osf.io

Tuna conduct daily vertical migrations and the vertical distribution of prey
species (microplankton) is highly relevant for their food intake

Accessible habitat index is accessible micronekton density

The final IATTC study used two environmental variables determining movement:
(1) SST
(2) Eddy kinetic energy

The discussion on day 2 focused primarily on environment variables and how SPC
catch and effort could be incorporated

The DTU model is likelihood-based, comparing observed and expected tag
recaptures. A tag is assumed to be released at a known location, moves according to
environmental variables in the Kalman filter model, and is recaptured later. Residuals are calculated by comparing the predicted mean and multivariate normal variance with the observed recapture position.

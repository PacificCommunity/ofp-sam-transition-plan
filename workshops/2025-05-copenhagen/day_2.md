The environmental data used in SEAPODYM are stored on osf.io

Tuna conduct daily vertical migrations and the vertical distribution of prey
species (microplankton) is highly relevant for their food intake

Accessible habitat index is accessible micronekton density

The IATTC study used two environmental variables determining movement:
(1) SST
(2) mixed layer depth

The discussion on day 2 focused primarily on environment variables and how SPC
catch and effort could be incorporated

The DTU model is likelihood-based, comparing observed and expected tag
recaptures. A tag is released at a known location, moves according to
environmental variables, and is recaptured later.

The model does not have random effects to allow process variability on top of
the deterministic model, but uses the Kalman filter instead. The effect of the
Kalman filter is similar to random effects, but much faster.

The environmental data used in SEAPODYM are stored on osf.io

Tuna conduct daily vertical migrations and the vertical distribution of prey
species (microplankton) is highly relevant for their food intake

Accessible habitat index is accessible micronekton density

The IATTC study used two environmental variables determining movement:
(1) SST
(2) mixed layer depth

The discussion on day 2 focused primarily on environment variables and how SPC
catch and effort could be incorporated

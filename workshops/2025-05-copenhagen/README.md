# SPC-DTU Workshop

**Copenhagen, 12-16 May 2025**

Anders Nielsen, Arni Magnusson, Joe Scutt Phillips, Tobias Mildenberger

## Objective

Explore the possibility of applying the Mildenberger-Nielsen spatio-temporal tagging model to SPC tagging data. The end product of such an analysis could be a region-specific abundance index that can be incorporated in a tuna stock assessment. The workshop will focus on skipjack tuna in the western and central Pacific Ocean.
